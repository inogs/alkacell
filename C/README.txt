README AlkaOpenCell.exe

Created by G.Bolzon and G.Cossarini

Calculation program for the evaluation of the total alkalinity (AT) 
and potential (E0) from potentiometric open-cell titration data. 


This routine is an upgrade of the routine written by A.G. Dickson for 
potentiometric close-cell titration data.
Refer to SOP 3a Determination of Total alkalinity in sea water using a 
close-cell titration (Dickson et al., 2007) for the original fortran code
and to  SOP 3b Determination of Total alkalinity in sea water using a 
open-cell titration (Dickson et al., 2007) for the equations of the open-cell 
titration procedure.
